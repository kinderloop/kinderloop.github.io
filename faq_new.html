					<p>Its as easy as this:</p>
					<p>1. <strong>Take a photo</strong> on your device</p> 
					<p>2. <strong>Write a short description</strong> about the learning/development/engagement occurring </p>
					<p>3. <strong>Link to your learning outcomes</strong>, practices and principles, centre philosophy, national quality standards, policies & procedures, educational visions etc </p>
					<p>4. <strong>Tag</strong> the child/ren</p>
					<p>5. <strong>Post to your private kinderloop!</strong> Simple!!</p>
					
					<p>Child care providers/educators post updates to their private Kinderloop on a web enabled device or via a computer. Posts consist of photos, news, developmental outcomes, anything that relates to the child/ren. </p>
					<p>Kinderloop automatically and securely posts the updates to the child's linked parents. Parents can securely login to see all of their child's updates either via the free app or on the web.</p>

                    <h3 class="name text-green">As a teacher, how do I start?</h3>
                    <p>We are constantly making it easier to setup your private Kinderloop - we realize that it will take a little effort to add your children and invite their family members. This is one reason we make the first month absolutely free.</p>
<p>1. First time setup, choose someone to act as an administrator (for setting up a center for the first time) 
On a web browser, go to www.kinderloop.com and click the signup button to enter your center's details and create your private Kinderloop. You can add staff, children and invite parents in the settings screen.</p>
<p>2. Search on your app store for 'kinderloop' and download the free app to your iphone, ipad, ipod touch or android device.</p>
<p>3. Signin with your username and password on your device or web browser, this will link to your private kinderloop. Ask your administrator for these details if you do not have them. You will then see the 'feed' screen showing all the moments you have recorded so far.</p>
<p>4. Start creating your posts. </p>
<p>Use photos and text to record events as a care provider, tag groups and children; each child you tag, the family members linked to that child will be updated immediately. Use 'other tags' to easily link your observation to a specific learning outcome. </p>

                    <h3 class="name text-green">Using the search function to report</h3>
                    <p>A tag is a special kind of link. In Kinderloop there are 2 kinds of tags. When you 'tag' a child, you create a link to them so that Kinderloop knows which parents to send the update to, the family linked will be securely notified that there has been an update.</p>
                    <p>'Other tags' are where you can create quick links to your developmental outcomes such as EYLF, EYLS etc. The search function (in your online settings) allows you to search on any criteria; children, observation tags, staff, dates. The results can be used to form developmental learning outcomes & documentation for each child.</p>

                    <h3 class="name text-green">How do parents connect?</h3>
                    <p>Parents will receive a secure email invite from their care educator, click the 'Get Started' link in that email and choose a username and password that you can remember and click 'Signup'. If you have multiple children, 'Signup' with the first email and with the subsequent invites, 'Login' with your new username and password from the first child.
