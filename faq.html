                    <p>We are constantly making it easier to setup your secure Kinderloop - we realize that it will take a little effort to add your children and invite their family members. This is one reason we make the first month absolutely free.</p>
<p>1. First time setup, choose someone to act as an administrator (for setting up a center for the first time) 
Educators, on a web browser, go to www.kinderloop.com and click the signup button to enter your center's details. You can add staff, children and invite parents in the settings screen.</p>
<p>2. Search on the app store for 'kinderloop' and download the free app to your iphone or ipad.</p>
<p>3. Signin with your username and password on your iphone, ipad or web browser. 
Ask your administrator for these details if you do not have them. You will then see the 'feed' screen showing all the moments you have recorded so far.</p>
<p>4. Start creating your posts. </p>
<p>Use photos and text to record events as a care provider, tag groups and children; each child you tag, the family members linked to that child will be updated immediately. Use 'other tags' to easily link your observation to a specific learning outcome. </p>

                    <h3 class="name text-green">Using the search function to report</h3>
                    <p>A tag is a special kind of link. When you 'tag' a child, you create a link to them so that Kinderloop knows which parents to send the update to.
For example, you can tag a photo to show who's in the photo and tag what they are doing. When you tag a child, the family linked will be securely notified that there has been an update.</p>
                    <p>The search function (in your online settings) allows you to search on any criteria; children, observation tags, staff, dates. The results can be used to form developmental learning outcomes for each child.</p>

                    <p>Parents, once they are ready, you will receive a secure invite from your care educator, click the 'Get Started' link in that email and input your details in the web page that opens. Choose a username and password that you can remember and click 'Signup'. If you have 2 children, 'Signup' with the first email and with the second, 'Login' with your new username and password from the first child.
