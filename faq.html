                    <h3>How do I setup my secure kinderloop?</h3>
                    <p>We are constantly making it easier to setup your secure Kinderloop - realize, however, that it will take a little effort to add your children and invite their family members. This is one reason we make the first month of membership absolutely free.</p>
<p>1. First time setup, choose someone to act as an administrator (for setting up a center for the first time) 
On a web browser, go to www.kinderloop.com Click the signup button; the next screen allows you to enter your center details. You can add staff, children and invite parents in the setup screen.</p>
<p>2. Download the app to your iphone or ipad. Search on the app store for 'kinderloop'</p>
<p>3. Signin with your username and password on your iphone, ipad or web browser. 
Ask your administrator for these details if you do not have them. You will then see the 'feed' screen showing all the moments you have recorded so far.</p>
<p>4. Start creating your posts. </p>
<p>Use photos and text to record events as a care provider, tag groups and children; each child you tag, the family members linked to that child will be updated immediately. Use 'other tags' to ceate your own. </p>

                    <h3>Is the data secure?</h3>
                    <p>Information about kids is sensitive to all parties involved. Even for non-medical information about the children, Kinderloop plans to ensure that our systems comply with the strict requirements of the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which includes encrypting data at rest and in transit, as well as security audits and other measures to ensure the data is safe and information about your children will never be shared without your permission.</p>
                    <p class="text-green"><strong>They're your pictures, not ours - we don't own them, we don't sell them, we don't share them.</strong></p>

                    <h3>Using the search function to report</h3>
                    <p>A tag is a special kind of link. When you tag a child, you create a link to them so that Kinderloop knows which parents to send the update to.
For example, you can tag a photo to show who’s in the photo and tag what they are doing to help with your reporting. When you tag a kid, the parents linked will be securely notified that there has been an update.</p>
                    <p>The search function allows you to search on any criteria; children, tags, staff, dates. The results can be used to form learning journeys for each child. (web only at this stage)</p>
