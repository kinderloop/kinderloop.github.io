					Nicole has been in the child care industry for 11 years, directing for 2 years. As an educator I'm a very strong believer of relationship building where secure relationships between educator & child and educator & family are developed, maintained & assured daily. </p>
					<p>I enjoy being creative & innovative & I regularly challenge my team with ideas that are 'outside of the norm'. Kinderloop created a safety net for our new families & assured the continuous development of relationships within my service. I think trust is everything in early childhood... Kinderloop guarantees this trust everyday.</p>
