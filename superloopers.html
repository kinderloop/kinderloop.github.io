					<p>Kinderloop provides exactly what a parent loves to see, a quick glimpse at their child's day, a quirky moment or a new learning opportunity they experienced that day. Not only do parents feel like they are still a part of their child's growth and daily activities, but they can expand on these moments at home with their children, by looking at the pictures together or providing them with similar activities in their own home. </p>

					Nicole has been in the child care industry for 11 years, directing for 2 years. As an educator I'm a very strong believer of relationship building where secure relationships between educator & child and educator & family are developed, maintained & assured daily. </p>

Kinderloop created a safety net for our new families & assured the continuous development of relationships within my service. I think trust is everything in early childhood... Kinderloop guarantees this trust everyday.</p>

                <p>My first experience with FDC was as a working Mum in 1991, twenty years later I've completed my diploma and there have been huge changes but I'm still loving my job as an educator with Macquarie Valley FDC. I am passionate about promoting Family Day Care  and I believe that strong relationships with families is paramount in all early childhood settings. Trying to balance family life and the paperwork associated with FDC is an ongoing battle for many educators. Discovering kinderloop reignited my passion for my job. I'm no longer struggling to stay on top of documentation and the parent response has been overwhelming.</p>
