                    Information about kids is sensitive to all parties involved. Even for non-medical
                    information about the children, Kinderloop plans to ensure that our systems comply
                    with the strict requirements of the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
                    Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which includes encrypting data at rest and in transit, as well
                    as security audits and other measures to ensure the data is safe and information about
                    your children will never be shared without your permission.

                    <p>When it comes to your own children, it is your choice what you share outside of Kinderloop. Remember though, that young children cannot make their own decisions about what gets published online. Therefore, you have a responsibility to make sure whatever is shared is in your children's best interests.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes other children in the center may feature in the same photos, videos and stories as your children. In these cases, never duplicate or upload them to internet/social networking sites or share them with anyone other than family members without those children's parents' permission.</p>
                    <p>If there is anything you don't understand or you need further clarification, please feel free to ask us any questions.</p>

                    <p>When sharing anything using the internet it is important that you and everyone else invited to your account understands about netiquette and staying safe online. Even if you are confident about cybersafety it would be a good idea to check if all those invited to your account have the knowledge they need, too.</p>
                    <p>While Kinderloop is a secure system, people without appropriate cybersafety knowledge can make it less secure by not keeping passwords safe, sharing information outside of Kinderloop or posting irresponsible content or comments. Cybersafety also involves keeping your computer and browser up-to-date, using the latest antivirus software and firewalls, and learning what suspicious or antisocial online behaviour looks like.</p>
                    <p>When choosing a password, choose something consisting of letters and numbers, that would be difficult to guess from public information about you. Never write your password down or share it with anyone. We will never request your password or personal details via email.</p>
                    <p class="text-green"><strong>They're your pictures, not ours - we don't own them, we don't sell them, we don't share them.</strong></p>

                    <p>Kinderloop is a password-protected private space for care providers and families to share stories, photos and videos with one another. Access to a child's information and stories can only be granted by their primary care provider, and no personal information is shared with any third party.</p>
                    <p>We work with ICT (Information and Communication Technology) security specialists to ensure we have the latest security systems in place, and we consult with early childhood specialists to ensure best practices. To learn more about how we keep your data safe, send us an email to <a href="mailto:support@kinderloop.com">support@kinderloop.com</a></p>
                    <p>Do you have parental permission to publish their children's information online?</p>
                    <p>It is the care providers' responsibility to provide parents with information about cybersafety and privacy, and you must gain their permission before publishing children’s information, work, images or videos on Kinderloop.</p>
