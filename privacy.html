					Your private Kinderloop is a password-protected secure space for early childhood educators, children and families to share updates, photos and learning outcomes with one another. Access to a childâ€™s information and updates can only be granted by their educator, and no personal information is shared with any third party, ever. We work with ICT (Information and Communication Technology) security specialists to ensure we have the latest security systems in place, which includes encrypting data at rest and in transit, as well as security audits and other measures to ensure the data is safe. We also consult with early childhood specialists to ensure best practices. To learn more about how we keep your data safe and if you fancy a good read, please contact us for our full privacy policy.

                    <h3><i class="fa fa-bullhorn text-green"></i> Sharing Kinderloop content</h3>
                    <p>When it comes to your own children, it is your choice what you share outside of Kinderloop. By signing up to Kinderloop, you agree to never share any content, image or otherwise, anywhere else online. Remember though, that young children cannot make their own decisions about what gets published online. Therefore, you have a responsibility to make sure that whatever you do share is in your children's best interests.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes other children in the center may feature in the same photos, videos and stories as your children. In these cases, we ask that you never duplicate or upload them to internet/social networking sites or share them with anyone other than family members.</p>
                    <p>If there is anything you don't understand or you need further clarification, please feel free to ask us any questions.</p>

                    <p>When sharing anything using the internet it is important that you are confident about cybersafety it would be a good idea to check if all those invited to your private Kinderloop have the knowledge they need, as well.</p>
                    <p>While Kinderloop is a secure system, people without appropriate cybersafety knowledge can make it less secure by not keeping passwords safe, sharing information outside of Kinderloop or posting irresponsible content or comments. Cybersafety also involves keeping your computer and browser up-to-date, using the latest antivirus software and firewalls, and learning what suspicious or antisocial online behaviour looks like.</p>
                    <p>When choosing a password, choose something consisting of letters and numbers, that would be difficult to guess from public information about you. Never write your password down or share it with anyone. We will never request your password or personal details via email.</p>
