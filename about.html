        <p>
            We hear it again and again from parents: We drop our kids off at preschool in the morning,
            and spend the day wondering what they're doing. We try to learn as much as we can during drop
            off and pickup, but things are always so hectic that it's hard to really feel involved.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is why we created Kinderloop. Kinderloop was founded by Dan Day, Dan Walker and Anne Gordon.
            We're parents of young children who crave more information from their school. We've had plenty of
            experience in creating educational software in some of the worlds largest educational authorities and
            our mission is to make it easy and fun for preschools to report on children in their care and have an informed and engaged community of parents.
