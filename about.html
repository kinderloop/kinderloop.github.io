            <p> <b>As time poor educators,</b> we have responsibilities of documenting, planning, recording, assessing and evaluating. With one simple and very easy to use program, Kinderloop allows us to achieve all these things, through our own private loop that links our families and educators together. It helps create a fun, holistic approach to managing our requirements under National Regulations, with ease. The future of early childhood documentation is here and its being shaped by educators like you. </p>
            <p> <b>Yes, we are busy parents too,</b> we feel a tad guilty dropping off our kids at preschool, daycare or OSHC in the morning, and spend the day wondering what they're doing. We try to learn as much as we can during drop off and pickup, but things are always so hectic that it's hard to really feel involved in their learning and development, our extended family are also less involved. Kinderloop solves this problem, we are now more connected than ever and can smile knowing that our family is fully engaged in our children's learning, play and interactions. </p>
            <p><b>With the help of amazing educators and family members in over 85 countries,</b> we are creating a continuum of learning and care around the kids, reconnecting the busy family and helping every educator save their precious time & resources. Kinderloop was founded by Dan Day over 5 years ago; trainee father to Poppy and Griffin, a dad who wanted to feel a little more involved with his childrens daily development. We've had experience in creating educational software in some of the worlds largest educational authorities and are excited to help early years educators have fun with technology.</p>
