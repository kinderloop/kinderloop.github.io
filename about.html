                            <b>As busy parents,</b> we drop our kids off at preschool in the morning, and spend the day wondering what they're doing. We try to learn as much as we can during drop off and pickup, but things are always so hectic that it's hard to really feel involved.

                            <b>As time poor educators,</b> we have responsibilities of documenting, planning, recording, assessing and evaluating. With one simple and very easy to use program, Kinderloop allows us to achieve all these things, through our own secure loop that links our families and educators together. It helps create a holistic approach for managing our requirements under the National Regulations and NQF, with ease.</b>

                        <p><b>With the help of educators in 35 countries,</b> we are helping create a continuum of care around the kids, to reconnect the busy extended family and to help every educator save some of their precious time & resources. Kinderloop was founded by the two Dan's; Dan Day and Dan Walker, busy parents of young kids who crave more information from their preschool. We've had experience in creating educational software in some of the worlds largest educational authorities and are excited to help care providers start having fun with technology.</p>
                        <p><b>Our mission is to make it easy and fun for preschools and care providers to capture those special moments in their care and have an informed and engaged community of parents, all centred around the kids.</b></p>
