                            <b>As busy parents,</b> we drop our kids off at preschool and daycare in the morning, and spend the day wondering what they're doing. We try to learn as much as we can during drop off and pickup, but things are always so hectic that it's hard to really feel involved in their learning and development, our extended family are also a little in the dark.

                            <b>As time poor educators,</b> we have responsibilities of documenting, planning, recording, assessing and evaluating. With one simple and very easy to use program, Kinderloop allows us to achieve all these things, through our own private loop that links our families and educators together. It helps create a holistic approach to managing our requirements under the National Regulations, with ease.</b>
